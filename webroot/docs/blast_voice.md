Our software will automatically dial the phone numbers in your contact list one after another and play the selected audio file. You can play different messages for answering machines, and you can set the Auto Dialer program to retry busy lines.

- You can send thousands of simultaneous phone calls from a single computer, and view real-time results.



- Use an easy spreadsheet to create call lists. Get easy to read results in real-time.



Autodialer software is a one-time purchase. You can use it for as long as you like with no per-text or subscription fees.
